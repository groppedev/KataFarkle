Kata Farkle
====

In the following kata we will play a variation of the classical [Farkle Dice Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle).  

In this version I put together a simplified set of rules, just to practicing Object Calisthenics.  

Rules
---

* 2 players, in turn, roll 5 dice
* The score is calculated according to the rules represented in the image below
* If your score is 500+ points, you are entitled to make another throw
* The first one that reaches (or overcomes) 10.000 points, wins

Notes
---
* The 1 and 5 are the only dice that score even if less than 3
* Three dice of one type give points equal to their value multiplicated by 100 
  (e.g. a triplet of dice 2 gives 200 points), except for one type: a triplet of 1 gives 1000 points
* The quaternes doubles the triplet points, while the five triples the triplet points
